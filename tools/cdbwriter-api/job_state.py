# wait time calculations, hold status and other job attributes
# which may be derived from job_prog events. Retrieval of job_prog
# events is external to this module.
#
# datetime objects are used for all representation of time
# timedelta objects are used for differential time
# end_window must be a datetime object in the same timezone as other related objects
#
# Two DAOs are instantiated in this module, one each for JOB_EVENTS and JOB_EVENT_CLASSES,
# as the the need for data from those tables is trivial.
