Classes:
ServiceLocator -- generic implementation
PollingServiceLocator -- network-aware
TimingServiceLocator -- timeout-based

The service-location component provides registration and lookup functions
to store the locations of dynamically addressed xmlrpc servers. It is used
directly by ComponentProxy to connect to components whose service location
is not configured statically locally.

This module currently provides three implementations of service-location:

The generic implementation, ServiceLocator, is completely passive, and
has no logic regarding the expiration or validity of the services and
locations registered. It is little more than a hash, storing service data
verbatim as it is registered and unregistered.

PollingServiceLocator extends the generic implementation by automatically
polling all registered services by calling their "ping" methods. This
verifies that (a) the component is serving at the specified location, and
(b) the component is responding.

TimingServiceLocator extends the generic implementation by aotomatically
expiring any service that has not registered in a given timeframe (specified
at initialization with the "expire" keyword argument). Services are expected
to register themselves regularly at an interval <= that timeframe.
