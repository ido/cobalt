Purpose:
These packages provide the integration code for Globus GRAM to submit,
 monitor, and kill jobs managed by the Cobalt resource manager. These
 packages were developed to support the NCAR/CU Blue Gene/L (frost) for use 
 on the TeraGrid.

Status:
This is a beta release of these packages.

Description:
Four components are available with these packages:
1 - The GRAM JobManager for Cobalt.
    This is the GRAM Perl module that provides the interface to the 
    Cobalt command line utilities. This modules extends the generic
    GRAM JobManager.pm and provides methods to submit, poll, and cancel
    jobs managed by Cobalt through the GRAM utilities. This modules
    is used by PRE-WS and WS GRAM.

    To submit jobs, this module generates a shell script with the
    appropriate cqsub command. This shell script is usually stored in
    the users ~/.globus directory. For polling jobs, cqstat is invoked
    periodically. For canceling jobs, cqdel is invoked.

    The setup for this package will search for the Cobalt command line
    utilities and populate the Perl module with the absolute paths
    to those tools.

2 - The GRAM Scheduler Event Generator (SEG) for Cobalt.
    This shared library implemented in C provides callbacks to GRAM
    for monitoring jobs managed by Cobalt. This library checks for logging
    information on the status of Cobalt jobs in the Cobalt accounting logs.
    It monitors the state of all Cobalt jobs and is not limited to those
    managed by GRAM. When a state change is found for a job (such as queued,
    executing, deleted, held, done, ...), a GRAM state change function is
    invoked to indicate that the job has changed states.  

    This component is required for WS GRAM only. It can be run manually
    by executing
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/libexec/globus-scheduler-event-generator -s cobalt \
      -t <the current epoch time>

3 - The GRAM Scheduler Event Generator (SEG) Setup Package for Cobalt
    This package performs several setup operations for register the 
    Cobalt SEG with the release of Globus at $GLOBUS_LOCATION. Of most
    importance, this package is responsible for setting the path
    to the Cobalt accounting logs to be used by the Cobalt SEG. This
    package is required for WS GRAM only.

4 - The WSRF GRAM Service for Cobalt
    This package register the Cobalt scheduler as valid scheduler that can
    be invoked by WS GRAM. This package is required for WS GRAM only.

Software Prerequisites:
- Globus Toolkit 4.0.1
  - pre-ws or ws gram must be configured
  - the sudo rules must be installed for ws gram
  - the host must contain the proprer security files

- >= Java 1.4.2

- >= Ant 1.6.5

- cobalt 0.97.0pre7a
  - the GRAM Scheduler Event Generator(SEG) depends upon the
    accounting log files

- >= Perl 5.8 

Install:
0 - Install as the globus user. The cobalt command line tools need to be
    in the PATH variable. The Globus Toolkit must also be installed 
    and configured. Ensure that the Globus environment is properly setup
    (the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.{sh,csh} has been sourced).

1 - Set the COBALT_HOME envoironment variable to the cobalt accounting 
    log directory (where the qm-YYYY_MM_DD.log files are located)
    On frost.ncar.teragrid.org, this is /bgl/local/logs

2 - Install the GT4 bundles. For pre-ws-gram, install the 
	globus_gram_job_manager_setup_cobalt package. For ws-gram, 
	install all four packages
    gpt-build globus_gram_job_manager_setup_cobalt-0.5.tar.gz  
    gpt-build globus_scheduler_event_generator_cobalt-0.5.tar.gz <globus flavor> 
    gpt-build globus_scheduler_event_generator_setup_cobalt-0.5.tar.gz 
    gpt-build globus_wsrf_gram_service_java_setup_cobalt-0.5.tar.gz

3 - Run the Globus postinstall tools
    gpt-postinstall 

Tested Platforms (host, cobalt release):
- frost.ncar.teragrid.org, cobalt 0.97.0pre7a
